# PCB Design Agent Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for an intelligent agent system that automates PCB design using LangChain/LangGraph and KiCad. The system will take user requirements in natural language, search for component documentation, design and route PCB layouts, perform simulations, and generate manufacturing files.

## System Components

### 1. User Interface Agent
- Handles natural language input from users
- Extracts design requirements and constraints
- Presents results and design options back to users
- Requests clarification for ambiguous requirements

### 2. Component Research Agent
- Searches component datasheets, documentation, and manufacturer details
- Identifies appropriate components matching requirements
- Creates a component database with specifications and footprints
- Selects optimal components based on availability, cost, and performance

### 3. Schematic Design Agent
- Creates circuit schematics based on user requirements
- Uses KiCad's eeschema Python API
- Assigns appropriate components from the component database
- Creates proper nets and connections
- Validates design against electrical rules

### 4. PCB Layout Agent
- Places components on the PCB based on design constraints
- Routes traces optimally using KiCad's pcbnew Python API
- Creates appropriate power and ground planes
- Sets up design rules (trace widths, clearances, etc.)
- Performs design rule checking (DRC)

### 5. Simulation Agent
- Sets up and runs electrical simulations
- Analyzes signal integrity, power integrity, and thermal performance
- Suggests improvements based on simulation results

### 6. Manufacturing Output Agent
- Generates Gerber files for manufacturing
- Creates bill of materials (BOM)
- Produces assembly drawings and documentation
- Validates manufacturing outputs

## Data Flow

1. User submits requirements to User Interface Agent
2. UI Agent processes and distributes tasks to specialized agents
3. Component Research Agent searches and selects components
4. Schematic Design Agent creates the circuit schematic
5. PCB Layout Agent creates the physical board layout
6. Simulation Agent validates the design
7. Manufacturing Output Agent prepares files for production
8. Results are returned to the user for approval

## Implementation Strategy

### LangGraph Agent Orchestration
- Use LangGraph's state management for complex workflows
- Implement human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical decisions
- Use persistence to save progress for long-running design tasks
- Implement specialized agents using the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern

### KiCad Integration
- Leverage KiCad's Python API for programmatic control
- Create Python modules for each design stage:
  - Schematic creation (eeschema)
  - Component placement (pcbnew)
  - Auto-routing (pcbnew)
  - DRC and validation
  - Gerber file generation

### Component Database
- Build a vector database of component datasheets
- Use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to find relevant components
- Store component specifications, footprints, and models

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Framework and Basic Integration
- Set up LangGraph agent framework
- Create basic KiCad Python API wrappers

- Integrate with simulation tools

### Phase 5: Manufacturing Output
- Add Gerber file generation
- Implement BOM creation
- Create assembly documentation

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Design Complexity**: PCB design has many interdependent constraints and requirements. The system must balance these effectively.

2. **Component Selection**: Finding the right components requires understanding complex tradeoffs between cost, performance, and availability.

3. **Routing Quality**: Auto-routing in PCB design is challenging. The system may need to combine AI approaches with KiCad's routing algorithms.

4. **Design Validation**: Ensuring designs meet electrical and manufacturing requirements is critical.

5. **Domain Knowledge**: The agents must embed significant domain expertise about PCB design best practices.

## Technical Requirements

1. Python environment with LangChain and LangGraph
2. KiCad installation with Python API access
3. Vector database for component information storage
4. LLM access for agent intelligence (Claude or similar)
5. Simulation tools integration capabilities
